# Adding unaligned DataFrames
# The DataFrames january and february, which have been printed in the IPython Shell, represent the sales a company made in the corresponding months.

# The Indexes in both DataFrames are called Company, identifying which company bought that quantity of units. The column Units is the number of units sold.

# If you were to add these two DataFrames by executing the command total = january + february, how many rows would the resulting DataFrame have? Try this in the IPython Shell and find out for yourself.
