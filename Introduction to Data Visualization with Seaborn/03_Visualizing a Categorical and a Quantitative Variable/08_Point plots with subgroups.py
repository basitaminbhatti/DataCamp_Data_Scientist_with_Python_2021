"""Point plots with subgroups
Let's continue exploring the dataset of students in secondary school. This time, we'll ask the question: is being in a romantic relationship associated with higher or lower school attendance? And does this association differ by which school the students attend? Let's find out using a point plot.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Use sns.catplot() and the student_data DataFrame to create a point plot with relationship status ("romantic") on the x-axis and number of absences ("absences") on the y-axis. Create subgroups based on the school that they attend ("school")"""
# Create a point plot with subgroups
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
