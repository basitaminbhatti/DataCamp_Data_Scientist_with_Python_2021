"""Changing style and palette
Let's return to our dataset containing the results of a survey given to young people about their habits and preferences. We've provided the code to create a count plot of their responses to the question "How often do you listen to your parents' advice?". Now let's change the style and palette to make this plot easier to interpret.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
