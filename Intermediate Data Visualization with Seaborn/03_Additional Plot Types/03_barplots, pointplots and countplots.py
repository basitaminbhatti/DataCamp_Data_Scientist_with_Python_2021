Create a countplot with the df dataframe and Model Selected on the y axis and the color varying by Region."""
# Show a countplot with the number of models used with each region a different color
sns.countplot(data=df,
              y="Model Selected",
              hue="Region")

"""
Create a pointplot with the df dataframe and Model Selected on the x-axis and Award_Amount on the y-axis.
Use a capsize in the pointplot in order to show the confidence interval."""
# Create a pointplot and include the capsize in order to show bars on the confidence interval
sns.pointplot(data=df,
              y='Award_Amount',
              x='Model Selected',
              capsize=.1)

"""Create a barplot with the same data on the x and y axis and change the color of each bar based on the Region column."""
# Create a barplot with each Region shown as a different color
sns.barplot(data=df,
            y='Award_Amount',
            x='Model Selected',
