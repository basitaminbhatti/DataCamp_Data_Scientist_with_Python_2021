"""Calculations with variables
Remember how you calculated the money you ended up with after 7 years of investing $100? You did something like this:

100 * 1.1 ** 7
Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The savings variable you've created in the previous exercise represents the $100 you started with. It's up to you to create a new variable to represent 1.1 and then redo the calculations!

Instructions
100 XP
Create a variable growth_multiplier, equal to 1.1.
Create a variable, result, equal to the amount of money you saved after 7 years.
Print out the value of result."""

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7

# Print out result
print(result)
