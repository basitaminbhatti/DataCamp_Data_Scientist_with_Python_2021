# Tree hyperparameters
# In the following exercises you'll revisit the Indian Liver Patient dataset which was introduced in a previous chapter.

# Your task is to tune the hyperparameters of a classification tree. Given that this dataset is imbalanced, you'll be using the ROC AUC score as a metric instead of accuracy.

# We have instantiated a DecisionTreeClassifier and assigned to dt with sklearn's default hyperparameters. You can inspect the hyperparameters of dt in your console.

# Which of the following is not a hyperparameter of dt?
