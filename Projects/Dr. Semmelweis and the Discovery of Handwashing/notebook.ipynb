If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"13f090f9f0"}},"execution_count":0,"outputs":[],"source":"# importing modules\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv into yearly\nyearly = pd.read_csv('datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv')\n\n# Print out yearly\nprint(yearly)","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"editable":false,"deletable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"],"dc":{"key":"45ea098e15"}},"source":"## 2.

The fate of Dr. Semmelweis\n<p>So handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval.

The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.</p>\n<p>One reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s.
