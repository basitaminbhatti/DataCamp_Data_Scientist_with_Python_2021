Throughout the course so far, you've been exposed to some common problems that you may encounter with your data, from data type constraints, data range constrains, uniqueness constraints, and now membership constraints for categorical values.

In this exercise, you will map hypothetical problems to their respective categories.

#### Instructions
- Map the data problem observed with the correct type of data problem.

# Categories of errors
In the video exercise, you saw how to address common problems affecting categorical variables in your data, including white spaces and inconsistencies in your categories, and the problem of creating new categories and mapping existing ones to new ones.

To get a better idea of the toolkit at your disposal, you will be mapping functions and methods from `pandas` and Python used to address each type of problem.

#### Instructions
- Map each function/method to the categorical data problem it solves.
