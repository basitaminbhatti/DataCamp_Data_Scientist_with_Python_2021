Set uk to be the timezone for the UK: 'Europe/London'.
Change local to be in the uk timezone and assign it to notlocal.

# Create the timezone object
uk = tz.gettz('Europe/London')

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in the UK?
notlocal = local.astimezone(uk)

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())
