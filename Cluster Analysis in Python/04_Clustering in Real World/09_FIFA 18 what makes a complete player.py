FIFA 18: what makes a complete player?
The overall level of a player in FIFA 18 is defined by six characteristics: pace (pac), shooting (sho), passing (pas), dribbling (dri), defending (def), physical (phy).

Here is a sample card:

Eden Hazard Player Card

In this exercise, you will use all six characteristics to create clusters. The data for this exercise is stored in a Pandas dataframe, fifa. features is the list of these column names and scaled_features is the list of columns which contains their scaled values. The following have been pre-loaded: kmeans, vq from scipy.cluster.vq, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns.

Use the kmeans() algorithm to create 2 clusters using the scaled features."""
